## Custom Events

You can create your own custom events that can be emitted and received on both
the frontend and backend. Events are able to emitted at both the application and
the window level. The receiver of the event gets data of where the event was
emitted from along with the data that was sent with the event. Events can be
cancelled by the receiver.

<Tabs syncKey="language">
    <TabItem label="Go" icon="seti:go">

    ```go
    app.OnEvent("event1", func(e \*application.CustomEvent) {
        app.Logger.Info("[Go] CustomEvent received", "name", e.Name, "data", e.Data,
        "sender", e.Sender, "cancelled", e.Cancelled) app.Logger.Info("[Go]",
        e.Data[0].(string)) // Logs "Hello from JS" to the terminal })

        window.EmitEvent("event2", "Hello from Go")
    }

    ```

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="JS" icon="seti:javascript">

    ```js
    wails.Events.Emit("event1", "Hello from JS");

    wails.Events.On("event2", function (event) {
        console.log("[JS] CustomEvent received", event);
        console.log(event.data); // prints "Hello from Go" to the webview console
    });
    ```

    </TabItem>

</Tabs>

### Emitting Events

<Tabs syncKey="language">
    <TabItem label="Go" icon="seti:go">

#### `application.EmitEvent(name string, data ...any)`

Emits an event from the application instance

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="JS" icon="seti:javascript">

#### `window.EmitEvent(name string, data ...any)`

Emits an event from the window instance

#### `wails.Events.Emit(event:wails.Events.EventData)`

Emits an event from the frontend sending an object with `name` and `data`
properties or the typescript type WailsEvent

    </TabItem>

</Tabs>

### Receiving Events

Events can be received on the application instance and the frontend with a
couple options of how you chose to receive them. You can register a single event
listener that will trigger every time the event is emitted or you can register
an event listener that will only trigger a specific number of times.

<Tabs syncKey="language">
    <TabItem label="Go" icon="seti:go">

#### `application.OnEvent(name string, handler func(data ...any))`

Registers an event on the application instance this will trigger every time the
event is emitted

#### `application.OnMultipleEvent(name string, handler func(data ...any), count int)`

Registers an event on the application instance this will trigger every time the
event is emitted up to the count specified

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="JS" icon="seti:javascript">

#### `wails.Events.On(name: string, callback: ()=>void)`,

Registers an event on the frontend, this function returns a function that can be
called to remove the event listener

#### `wails.Events.Once(name: string, callback: ()=>void)`,

Registers an event on the frontend that will only be called once, this function
returns a function that can be called to remove the event listener

#### `wails.Events.OnMultiple(name: string, callback: ()=>void, count: number)`,

Registers an event on the frontend that will only be called `count` times, this
function returns a function that can be called to remove the event listener

    </TabItem>

</Tabs>

### Removing Events

There are a few ways to remove events that are registered. All of the
registration functions return a function that can be called to remove the event
listener in the frontend. There are additional functions provided to help remove
events as well.

<Tabs syncKey="language">
    <TabItem label="Go" icon="seti:go">

#### `application.OffEvent(name string, ...additionalNames string)`

Removes an event listener with the specified name

#### `application.ResetEvents()`

Removes all registered events and hooks

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="JS" icon="seti:javascript">

#### `wails.Events.OffAll()`

Removes all registered events

#### `wails.Events.Off(name: string)`

Removes an event listener with the specified name

    </TabItem>
